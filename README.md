BRIEF - AirportX_App

Using the included flights.json file, create an API using Node.js, Express and MySQL.  Also create a simple React app to call the API and display the flights in a table that can be filtered.


Errors should be caught and handled.
The dates are strings in DD/MM/YYYY format. Is there a better solution?

MVP:

- Errors should be caught and handled.
- React app should be designed so that it can be scaled. Consider component hierarchy and structure. 




EXTENTIONS:

- Refactor API to ensure it can be scaled if it were a production service
- The dates are strings in DD/MM/YYYY format. Is there a better solution?

ADVANCED EXTENTIONS:
- Add Authentication
- Add rate limiting to imporove performance. 
- Perfect the frontend styling.

Learnings:

- Using MySQL and implementing a relational database into a Node backend. I have used relational databases extensivly in Django, Flask and Spring but have only used none relational databases like MongoDB in a node backend.
